# World_Weather_Analysis

## Purpose
Here we use pandas, APIs, Jupyter Notebooks, and gmaps to determine and map potential travel destinations, itinerary, and location data.  First, we generate random coordinates, longitude and latitude.  We then find the nearest lodging(ie. hotels) to each location, and collected data about those locations.  This data is put into a dataframe, and after restricting our criteria by maximum temperature, we in turn use this dataframe to generate maps with markers.  From these we can isolate four locations that are close in proximity.  We use these four to generate an itinerary- maps with markers and directions between those markers.
